First we prove that $\shdhsat$ is in $\eqso(\ehorn)$. Recall that each instance of $\shdhsat$ is a disjunction of Horn formulas. Let $\R$ be a relational signature such that $\R = \{\pP(\cdot,\cdot), \pN(\cdot,\cdot), \pV(\cdot), \pNC(\cdot), \pD(\cdot,\cdot)\}$. Each symbol in this vocabulary is used to indicate the same as in Example \ref{ex-hornsat-esop1}, with the addition of $\pD(d,c)$ which indicates that $c$ is a clause in the formula $d$. Recall that the formula $\sa{\pT} \sa{\pA} \psi(\pT,\pA)$
defines $\chsat$. In order to encode $\shdhsat$, we extend $\psi(\pT,\pA)$ by adding the information of $\pD(d,c)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
\psi'(T,A) \ := \ \ex{d} \big[ \ & \fa{x} (\neg \pT(x) \vee \pV(x)) \ \wedge\\
& \fa{c} (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee \neg \textit{NC}(c) \vee  \ex{x} \neg \textit{A}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\
& \fa{c} \fa{x} (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\neg \textit{P}(c,x) \vee \ex{y} \neg \textit{A}(c,y) \vee \textit{T}(x)) \ \wedge\\
& \fa{c} \fa{x} (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\neg \textit{N}(c,x) \vee \textit{T}(x) \vee \neg \textit{A}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\
& \fa{c} \fa{x}  (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\textit{A}(c,x) \vee \textit{N}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\
& \fa{c} \fa{x} (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\textit{A}(c,x) \vee \neg\textit{T}(x)) \ \big]
\end{align*}
One can check that $\psi'(T,A)$ effectively defines $\shdhsat$ as for every disjunction of Horn formulas $\theta = \theta_1\vee\cdots\vee\theta_m$ encoded by an $\R$-structure $\A$, the number of satisfying assignments of $\theta$ is equal to $\sem{\sa{\pT} \sa{\pA} \psi'(\pT,\pA)}(\A)$.  Therefore, we conclude that $\shdhsat \in \eqso(\ehorn)$.

Next, we will prove that $\shdhsat$ is hard for $\eqso(\ehorn)$ over a signature~$\R$ under parsimonious reductions. For each $\eqso(\ehorn)$ formula $\alpha$ over $\R$, we will define a polynomial-time function $g_{\alpha}$ that  receives an $\R$-structure $\A$ and outputs an instance of $\shdhsat$ such that $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \shdhsat(g_{\alpha}(\A))$. By Proposition~\ref{theo-pnf-snf}, we can assume that $\alpha$ is of the form:
$$
\alpha \ = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}} \ex{\bar{y}} \bigwedge_{j = 1}^{n} \fa{\bar{z}} \varphi^i_j(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z}),
$$
where each $\varphi^i_j$ is a Horn-clause.
Now, consider a finite $\R$-structure $\A$ with domain $A$. 
The first transformation of $\alpha$ and $\A$ towards a disjunction of horn-formulas is to replace each first-order quantifier (i.e. $\Sigma{\bar{x}}$,  $\exists\bar{y}$, and $\forall\bar{z}$) with first-order constants. Specifically, the following formula defines the same function as $\alpha$ and is of polynomial size with respect to $\A$:
$$
\alpha_{\A} \ = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \sum_{\bar{a}\in A^{\length{\bar{x}}}} \sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{\bar{b}\in A^{\length{\bar{y}}}}\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{n}\bigwedge_{\bar{c}\in A^{\length{\bar{z}}}}\varphi^i_j(\bar{X},\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c}).
$$
Note that each first-order subformula in $\varphi^i_j(\bar{X},\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c})$ has no free variable and, therefore, we can evaluate each of them in polynomial time and replace by $\perp$ and $\top$ wherever it corresponds. In other words, in polynomial time we can replace $\varphi^i_j$ by a conjunction of $\neg X_{h}$'s and at most one $X_{h}$.
After simplifying, grouping and reordering the previous formula, we can obtain an equivalent formula $\alpha_{\A}'$ of the form:
$$
\alpha_{\A}' \ := \ \sum_{i = 1}^{m'}\sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{n_1'}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{n_2'}\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})
$$
where every $\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ is a disjunction of $\neg X_{h}$'s and at most one $X_{h}$.
The reader can easily check that $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \sem{\alpha_{\A}'}(\A)$. 

The idea for the rest of the proof is to show how to obtain $g_{\alpha}(\A)$, i.e. an instance of $\shdhsat$, from $\alpha_{\A}'$.
First, if $\alpha_{\A}'$ is equal to $\sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{n_1'}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{n_2'}\psi_{j,k}(\bar{X})$, then we can define $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ equal to the propositional formula $\bigvee_{j = 1}^{n_1'}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{n_2'}\psi_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ over the propositional alphabet $\{X(\bar{e}) \mid X \in \bar{X} \text{ and } \bar{e}\in A^{\arity(X)} \}$ which has exactly $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$ satisfying assignments and is precisely a disjunction of Horn formulas.
Otherwise, if $m' > 1$ we can use $m'$ new fresh variables $t_1,\ldots,t_{m'}$ and define:
$$
g_{\alpha}(\A) \ := \ \bigvee_{i=1}^{m'} \, \bigvee_{j = 1}^{n_1'} \, \bigwedge_{k = 1}^{n_2'} \, \psi^i_{j,k}(\bar{X}) \wedge t_i \wedge \bigwedge_{l \neq i} \neg t_l
$$ 
over the propositional alphabet $\{X(\bar{e}) \mid X \in \bar{X} \text{ and } \bar{e}\in A^{\arity(X)} \} \cup \{t_1,\ldots,t_{m'}\}$.
Intuitively, variables $t_1,\ldots,t_{m'}$ are used to count from $1$ to $m'$ each subformula $\sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{n_1'}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{n_2'}\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ in $\alpha_{\A}'$.
One can easily check that $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ is a disjunction of Horn formulas, and the number of satisfying assignments is exactly $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$. This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$, and the entire procedure takes polynomial time.
