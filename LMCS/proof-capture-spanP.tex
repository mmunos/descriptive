Similar than the previous proof, we construct recursively a $\spp$ machine $M_{\alpha}$ for each $\eqso(\eso)$ formula $\alpha$ over a signature $\R$. This machine, on input $(\A,v,V)$, non-deterministically produces $\sem{\alpha}(\A,v,V)$ distinct accepting outputs for each $(\A,v,V) \in \ostr[\R]^*$. Suppose $\A$ has domain $A$. 
If $\alpha$ is a $\eso$-formula $\varphi$ it checks if $(\A,v,V)\models\varphi$ non-deterministically in polynomial time \cite{F75}, and accepts if and only if the condition holds true. 
If $\alpha$ is a constant $s$, then the machine produces $s$ branches and accepts in all of them. 
If $\alpha = (\beta \add \gamma)$, then it chooses between 0 or 1, if it is 0 (1), it simulates $M_{\beta}$ ($M_{\gamma}$) on input $(\A,v,V)$.  
If $\alpha = \sa{x}\beta$, it chooses $a\in A$ non-deterministically and simulates $M_{\beta}$ on input $(\A,v[a/x],V)$. 
If $\alpha = \sa{X} \beta$, it chooses $B\in A^{\arity(X)}$ and simulates $M_{\beta}$ on input $(\A,v,V[B/X])$. 
This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$.
Additionally, the machine produces a different output on each path. This can be done by printing the trace of all the non-deterministic choices.
However, when the machine starts checking whether $(\A,v,V)\models\varphi$ for some $\eso$ formula $\varphi$, it stops printing in the output tape. This way the machine produces exactly one output from that point onwards.
Let $\alpha$ be a formula in $\eqso(\eso)$ over a signature $\R$ and let $f$ be a function over $\R$ such that $f(\enc(\A))$ is equal to the number of accepting outputs of $M_{\alpha}$ on input $(\A,v,V)$ for some $(\A,v,V) \in \ostr[\R]^*$. 
We have that $f$ is a $\spp$ function over $\R$ and that $f(\enc(\A)) = \sem{\alpha}(\A)$ for every $\A\in\ostr[\R]$.

For the other direction, Compton et al.~\cite{ComptonG96} proved that $\spp = \#\eso$. Since a function in $\#\eso$ can also be defined in $\eqso(\eso)$, then $\eqso(\eso)$ captures $\spp$ over ordered structures.
