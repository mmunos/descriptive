\item[$\checkmark$] p.2, first paragraph: ``However, other function classes have emerged from the need to understand
the complexity of some computation problems for which little can be said if their
decision counterparts are considered.'' Why can only little be said about the decision counterparts
of the examples mentionend afterwards?
\item[$\checkmark$] p.7, first sentence: ``fragments or extensions [...] obtained by restricting'': extensions are not
obtained by restricting something
\item[$\checkmark$] p.10, before Thm. 4.5: ``by considering second-order product'': We need both second-order
product and sum (at least both are used in Thm. 4.5)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.10, last line: ``$B$-th bit'': mention in what way $B$ is interpreted as a number
\item[$\checkmark$] p.12: ``To formalize this set of optimization problems'': class instead of set
\item[$\checkmark$] p.14: ``we have to concentrate on the class of counting problems with easy decision versions'':
here, easy decision version means ``in \bpp''. Before, it was defined as ``in P''. Should be
consistent.
\item[$\checkmark$] p.14: ``as expected, $\Sigma \bar{X}$ is the respective nesting of $\Sigma X.$’s'': why is this explained for secondorder
quantifiers but not for first-order quantifiers?
\item[$\checkmark$] p.14: $\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i$: explain that this is notation for $\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_n$
\item[$\checkmark$] p.17: ``Since $\alpha$ is not null'' $\to$ ``Since $\sem{\alpha}$ is not the identically zero function'' (or similar)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.17/18: In the proof of Prop 5.3, the vocabulary only contains the numerical predicate $<$. When encoding structures as binary words, numerical predicates are implicit (and not
encoded), though. What is the intended meaning here?
\item[$\checkmark$] p.18, after proof of Claim 5.4: ``which implies that 2 $\in \eqso(\Sigma_0)$ and $2 \not\in \E{1}$'': $2 \in \eqso(\Sigma_0)$
does not follow from the argument before as stated in this sentence, but is trivial
\item[$\checkmark$] p.18: ``Also, suppose that it is in $\L$-PNF'': $\L$ should be $\LL$ , PNF should be SNF
\item[$\checkmark$] p.19, end of proof of Prop. 5.5: ``which violates the inequality'' $\to$ ``which violates the inequality
for large structures''
\item[$\checkmark$] p.20: ``we will show a formula in the grammar'' $\to$ ``... in the logic''
\item[$\checkmark$] p.20: ``Since $\Sigma_1$ is closed under conjunction, then Lemma 5.7 holds for ...'' $\to$ ``Since $\Sigma_1$ is
closed under cnojunction, Lemma 5.7 can be applied to ...'' (or similar)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.22: ``and leaving each $R_{\psi}^{\A}$ empty'' $\to$ $R_{\psi}^{\A'}$
\item[$\checkmark$] p.22: ``To show that $\alpha$ is in \totp'' $\to$ ``To show that the function defined by $\alpha$ ...'' (or similar)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.22: ``Let $\alpha$ = ... where $\varphi$ is an FO-formula'' $\to$ ``... where $\varphi$ is an $\Sigma_1$[FO]-formula''
\item[$\checkmark$] p.23, formulae: Maybe put (large) parantheses around the relativization of quantifiers, for
example the part of formula $\varphi_i$ after the quantifiers
\item[$\checkmark$] p.24, formula 5.6: subscript of large conjunction: $\varphi_i^{+}(\bar{X},\bar{v})$ $\to$ $\varphi_i^{+}(\bar{X},\bar{y})$
\item[$\checkmark$] p.25: ``We construct a function $\lambda$ that receives a quantitative formula $\beta$ ...'' $\to$ ``... that receives
a formula $\beta \in \eqso(\logex{1})$ ...''
\item p.25, last sentence: ``which is based on considering some witnesses of logarithmic size'' could
be explained a little more / made more clear
\martin{no logr\'e completar esta correcci\'on}
\item[$\checkmark$] p.26: ``... auxiliary predicate $A$ defined as'' $\to$ ``... auxiliary predicate $A$ which will be defined
as ... in the formula'' (or similar)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.28: ``since universal formulas are monotone over induced substructures'': ``monotone over
induced substructures'' should be reformulated
\item[$\checkmark$] p.28: ``Next we prove that ... is hard for ... over a signature $\R$ ...'' sounds like it only works
for one specific vocabulary. Maybe simply ``over any signature $\R$''
\item[$\checkmark$] p.28, formula $\alpha_{\A}$: second big conjunction should have $\bar{z}'$ in the subscript instead of $\bar{z}$ (because
the quantifier $\forall u$ is handled by this as well if I understand correctly)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.29: ``In other words, in poly time we can replace $\varphi_j^i$ by a disjunction of ....'': Some of these
formulae might evaluate to $\perp$ or $\top$ altogether and can be removed (potentially together with
the surrounding conjunction)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.29: ``Intuitively $t_1,\ldots,t_{m'}$ are used to count from 1 to $m'$ each subformula ...'': Should be
reformulated, maybe rather write that they are used to have disjoint sets of propositional
assignments for the different disjuncts of the outermost disjunction (corresponding to the
summands in the original formula)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.30, proof of Prop. 5.12: For $\dhsat \in \totp$, [35] is cited. It’s stated that a \totp-procedure
for DNF-SAT is given there and it can be adapted to \dhsat. While the
cited paper contains the result for DNF-SAT, the procedure is not explicitly given as far as
I can see, so I can't check whether it is adaptable. On the other hand, membership of any
function counting the number of satisfying assignments for a class of propositional formulae
with poly-time decision version in \totp should hold by a similar argument as membership in
DelayP. Maybe change the citation or give a short proof sketch.
\item[$\checkmark$] p.31, definition of $\leq$ on $\F$: ``$f(i) \leq g(i)$ for every $i \in \{1,\ldots,\ell\}$'': Inputs for $f$ and $g$ should be
elements of $A^{\ell}$, not $\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$
\item[?] p.32/33, example 6.2: I don't see why the formula given for dag's does not work for arbitrary
graphs: In arbitrary graphs, the fixpoint is still reached after at most $n-1$ steps, since the
maximal length of any shortest path in any graph is $n-1$. On the other hand, assuming that
I am mistaken and the support does not become stable within $n-1$ steps: Using the formula
given for arbitrary graphs, the support of the constructed function restricted to those tuples
that have first in their last component is the same as the support of the constructed function
using the formula for dags in each step of the recursion. Hence, the formula should not be
able to fix such a problem.
\martin{me gustar\'ia tener feedback para saber si mi correcci\'on est\'a bien}
\item[$\checkmark$] p.33: ``executes exactly $n^k$ steps for a fixed $k \geq 1$'' → ``executes exactly $n^k$
steps on large
inputs for a fixed $k \geq 1$'' (at least it does not work for $n = 1$) (small inputs can be handled
seperately)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.35 and p.36: While $\sum$ was used for finite sums in \qso-formulae throughout the paper, now
a large +-sign is used. This might be confusing
\item[$\checkmark$] p.36: $\alpha_{q_i}$ used instead of $\alpha_{s_{q_{i}}}$
\item[$\checkmark$] p.36: ``Clearly, at each iteration of the fixed point operator, the tuple $\bar{t}$ represents the step the
machine is currently in.'': This is quite vague. Maybe something like ``Clearly, tuple $\bar{t}$ encodes
the number of steps the machine has done and in each iteration of the fixed point operator,
one timestep of the machine is executed''
\item[$\checkmark$] p.36: ``at the $\bar{a}$-th iteration of the fixed point operator, it holds that $f(\bar{a}, \bar{b}) \leq 1$ and $f(\bar{a}', \bar{b}) = 0$ for every $\bar{b} \in A^k$. 
In the same way, it can be seen that for each function $g \in \ldots$ it holds that $g(\bar{a}) \leq 1$ and $g(\bar{a}')= 0$. 
I think that more properties of these functions should be mentioned
in order to argue that the defined function is the function computed by the machine:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] For each $\bar{b}$, only one of the functions $T_0$,$T_1$,$T_B$,$T_{\vdash}$ outputs 1 on input ($\bar{a}, \bar{b})$
\item[-] For each $\bar{b}$, only one of the functions $h,\hat{h}$ outputs 1 on input $(\bar{a}, \bar{b})$
\item[-] There is exactly one $\bar{b}$ with $h(\bar{a}, \bar{b}) = 1$
\item[–] There is exatcly one $i$ such that $s_{q_i}(\bar{a}) = 1$
\end{itemize}
(It could also generally be argued that the functions are 0/1-functions encoding the intended
predicates and are 0 when the timestep is the successor of the current timestep)
\item[$\checkmark$] p.36: ``is defined as an extension of QFO with the formula ...'' $\to$	 ``is defined as the extension
of QFO by the additional operator ...'' (or similar)

\section*{Reviewer 2}

\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
\item In several proofs, you rely on disjoint union of solutions and cartesian product of solutions. Indeed, its gives a polynomial time counting reduction. Can you make connections with (+,*) circuits ? It would be similar to what is done in A Circuit-Based Approach to Efficient Enumeration (Antoine Amarilli, Pierre Bourhis, Louis Jachiet, Stefan Mengel) where simple circuits (dDNNF, which are basically disjoint unions and cartesian products) are used to capture the solutions of MSO queries.

\item In general I would be interested to know the relationship of your couting classes with their enumeration counterpart. 
For instance there is a paper adapting [39] to enumeration: Enumeration Complexity of Logical Query Problems with Second-order Variables (Arnaud Durand and Yann Strozecki). In particular they consider class with some Horn structure to capture easy enumeration problems, it may have some connection with the class $\sigma$ QSO($\Pi_1$ Horn) you introduce.

\item For the most involved proofs, you could describe informally your proof strategy in a few lines to help the reader. You may also add some example to illustrate the different fragment of QSO (you already do it sometimes and it is very helpful).
\martin{me gustar\'ia que conversemos qu\'e demostraciones necesitan esto, y si el outline de la demostraci\'on de -1 basta. Tambi\'en qu\'e fragmentos de QSO necesitan un ejemplo.}
