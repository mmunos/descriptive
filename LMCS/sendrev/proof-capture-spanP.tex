To prove condition (2), we use the fact that $\spp = \#(\eso)$. The condition holds using the same argument as in Proposition~\ref{prop:capture-shP}.
For condition (1), notice that given an $\eso$ formula $\varphi$, checking whether $\A\models\varphi$ can be done in non-deterministic polynomial time on the size of $\A$\cite{fagin1974generalized}. 
Therefore, a $\spp$ machine for $\varphi$ will simulate the non-deterministic polynomial time machine and produce the same string as output in each accepting non-deterministic run. Furthermore, any constant function $s$ can be trivially simulated in $\spp$ and, thus, condition (1) holds analogously to Proposition \ref{prop:capture-shP} since $\spp$ is also closed under exponential sum and polynomial product~\cite{OH93}.
%Similar than the previous proof, we construct recursively a $\spp$ machine $M_{\alpha}$ for each $\eqso(\eso)$ formula $\alpha$ over a signature $\R$. This machine, on input $(\A,v,V)$, non-deterministically produces $\sem{\alpha}(\A,v,V)$ distinct accepting outputs for each $\A \in \ostr[\R]$. Suppose $\A$ has domain $A$. 
%If $\alpha$ is a $\eso$-formula $\varphi$ it checks if $(\A,v,V)\models\varphi$ non-deterministically in polynomial time \cite{F75}, and accepts if and only if the condition holds true. 
%If $\alpha$ is a constant $s$, then the machine produces $s$ branches and accepts in all of them. 
%If $\alpha = (\beta \add \gamma)$, then it chooses between 0 or 1, if it is 0 (1), it simulates $M_{\beta}$ ($M_{\gamma}$) on input $(\A,v,V)$.  
%If $\alpha = \sa{x}\beta$, it chooses $a\in A$ non-deterministically and simulates $M_{\beta}$ on input $(\A,v[a/x],V)$. 
%If $\alpha = \sa{X} \beta$, it chooses $B\in A^{\arity(X)}$ and simulates $M_{\beta}$ on input $(\A,v,V[B/X])$. 
%This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$.
%Additionally, the machine produces a different output on each path. This can be done by printing the trace of all the non-deterministic choices.
%However, when the machine starts checking whether $(\A,v,V)\models\varphi$ for some $\eso$ formula $\varphi$, it stops printing in the output tape. This way the machine produces exactly one output from that point onwards.
%Let $\alpha$ be a formula in $\eqso(\eso)$ over a signature $\R$ and let $f$ be a function over $\R$ such that $f(\enc(\A))$ is equal to the number of accepting outputs of $M_{\alpha}$ on input $(\A,v,V)$ for some $\A \in \ostr[\R]$. 
%We have that $f$ is a $\spp$ function over $\R$ and that $f(\enc(\A)) = \sem{\alpha}(\A)$ for every $\A\in\ostr[\R]$.
