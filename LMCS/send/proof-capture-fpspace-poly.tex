In this proof, both conditions are analogous to Theorem~\ref{theo:capture-fp} and~\ref{theo:capture-fpspace}. For the first condition, each $\pfp$ formula $\varphi$ can be evaluated in $\pspace$ and the class is closed under first sum and product. For the second condition, we use the same language $L$ defined in the proof of Theorem~\ref{theo:capture-fp}, which in this case is in $\pspace$. The same construction of $\alpha$, which in turn is in $\qfo(\pfp)$, is used to show that the condition holds.
