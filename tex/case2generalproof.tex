Let $\varphi^\prime(\x,\X) = \varphi_1^\prime(\x,\X)\vee\cdots\vee\varphi_k^\prime(\x,\X).$ We will now show that $f_{\exists\x\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)} = f_{\exists\x\varphi(\x,\X)}\dotminus 1.$ Assume that $\A\in\Truc$. Suppose first that there is at least one assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi(\x,\R).$ Let $q$ be the least index such that there exists an assignment $\R^\prime$ to $\X$ for which $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi_q(\x,\R^\prime).$ Let $\d = (\d_1,\dots,\d_{n_q},\ep)$ be the lexicographically smallest assignment to $\x$ for which $\A\models\alpha_q(\d)$, where $\d_i$ is the corresponding assignment to $\x_i$, for every $i\in\{1,\dots,n_q\}$, and $\ep$ is an assignment for $\y$. Consider now the tuple $\P = (P_1,\dots,P_r)$ where $P_i = \bigcup_{j:\lambda_q(j)=i,j\in[1,n_q]}\{\d_j\}$. As we did in Lemma \ref{first} we will show that $\P$ is such that (a) $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi(\x,\P),$ (b) $\A\not\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime(\x,\P),$ and (c) $\P$ is the only assignment to $\X$ that satisfies both (a) and (b)
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] As we showed in part (a) of Lemma \ref{first}, if there is at least one assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi_q(\x,\R)$, then $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi_q(\x,\P)$ for this particular $\P$. However, as we showed in Claim \ref{alpha}, if there is an assignment $\s$ to $\x$ such that $\A\models\alpha_q(\s)$, then there {\em is} such an assignment to $\X$. The assignment $\d$ to $\x$ satisfies that $\A\models\alpha_q(\d)$, so it holds that $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi_q(\x,\P)$. It immediately follows that $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi(\x,\P).$

\item[(b)] We will show that $\A\not\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime_i(\x,\P)$ for (1) $i\in\{1,\ldots,q-1\}$, and (2) $i\in\{q,\ldots,k\}$. (1) By the choice of $q$, it holds that $\A\not\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime_i(\x,\P)$ for every $i\in\{1,\ldots,q-1\}$ since there is no possible assignment to $\X$ for any of their sub-formulas $\varphi_i(\x,\X)$. (2) We can use the proof in Lemma \ref{first} to see that $\A\not\models\psi_q(\P).$ For each $i\in\{q,\ldots,k\}$, the sub-formula 
$$ \zeta_q(\X) =  (\exists\v\:\alpha_1(\v)\vee\cdots\vee\exists\v\:\alpha_{q-1}(\v)\vee\psi_q(\X)) $$ 
appears as a conjunct in $\varphi^\prime_i(\x,\X)$. However, by the choice of $q$, there is no $i\in\{1,\ldots,q-1\}$ such that $\A\models\exists\v\:\varphi_i(\v,\P)$, and also $\A\not\models\psi_q(\P)$. It follows that $\A\not\models\zeta_q(\P)$,  so $\A\not\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime_i(\x,\P)$. And so, we conclude that $\A\not\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime(\x,\P).$

\item[(c)] Suppose there is an assignment $\P^\prime \neq \P$ to $\X$ that satisfies both (a) and (b). As we deduce from the part (c) of Lemma \ref{first}, $\P$ is the only assignment to $\X$ such that $\A\not\models\:\psi_q(\P)$, so necessarily $\A\models\:\psi_q(\P^\prime)$. Since $\P^\prime$ assigned to $\X$ satisfies (a), then $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi(\x,\P^\prime).$ By the choice of $q,$ every $i\in\{1,\ldots,q-1\}$ is such that $\A\models\forall\x\:\neg\alpha_i(\x)$, so $\A\models\psi_i(\P^\prime)$ for each $i$. But as we mentioned, also $\A\models\:\psi_q(\P^\prime),$ which means that $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime_q(\x,\P^\prime),$ and so, $\A\models\exists\x\:\varphi^\prime(\x,\P^\prime),$ which leads to a contradiction.

Al igual que un argumento anterior, esta demostración es mas clara si es directa y NO por contradicción.

\end{enumerate}

With this, we conclude that for every $\A\in\Truc$ such that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)>0$, we have that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)}(\A) = f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)-1.$

Second, assume that there is no assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi_i(\x,\R)$ for every $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. Let $\P$ be an arbitrary assignment to $\X$. Since $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi_i(\x,\P)$, for any $i,$ we see that $\A\not\models\exists\x\,(\varphi(\x,\P)\wedge\chi(\x,\P))$ for any formula $\chi(\x,\P)$. It follows that there is no assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime_i(\x,\R),$ for any $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. And so, for every $\A\in\Truc$ such that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)=0,$ we have that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)}(\A) = 0.$ Hence, from the results in the previous paragraph, if $f^\prime = f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)}$, we have that $f^\prime = f\dotminus 1\in\E1$.

Importante! Aqui falta argumentar porque la formula final esta en $\E1$.
