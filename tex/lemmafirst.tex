\begin{lemma} \label{first}
$f_{\exists \x \: \varphi^\prime(\x,\X)} = f_{\exists \x \: \varphi(\x,\X)} \dotminus 1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\A \in \Truc$. Consider two cases: assume first that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\R)$ for some assignment $\R$ to $\X$. Let $\d = (\d_1,\dots,\d_n,\ep)$ be the lexicographically smallest assignment to $\x$ for which $\A\models\alpha(\d)$, where $\d_i$ is the respective assignment to $\x_i$, for every $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$, and $\ep$ is an assignment for $\y$. Consider now the tuple $\P = (P_1,\dots,P_r)$ where $P_i = \bigcup_{j\in[1,n]:\:\lambda(j)=i}\{\d_j\}$. We will show that this assignment to $\X$ is such that (a) $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\P),$ (b) $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\P)$ and (c) $\P$ is the only assignment that satisfies (a) and (b).
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] By contradiction, suppose that $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\P)$. That is, there is no assignment $\s$ to $\x$ such that $\A\models\varphi(\s,\P).$ Since $\d$ is such that $\A\models \bigwedge_{i=1}^n P_{\lambda(i)}(\d_i)$ and $\A\models \alpha(\d)$, it follows that $\A\not\models\varphi^{-}(\P,\ep)$ (since $\alpha(\d)=\theta(\d)\wedge\beta(\d)$). Therefore, there is an $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\neg P_{\lambda(i)}(\d_i)$ appears in $\varphi^{-}(\P,\ep)$. Then, there is an $a_{\lambda(i)}$-tuple $\z$ in $\y$ such that $\neg X_{\lambda(i)}(\z)$ appears in $\varphi^{-}(\X,\x)$. We know that either (1) $\theta(\x)\models \z = \x_i$, (2) $\theta(\x)\models \varphi_{<,a_i}(\z,\x_i)$ or (3) $\theta(\x)\models \varphi_{<,a_i}(\x_i,\z)$. Considering that (2) and (3) are not possible given that both $\z$ and $\x_i$ are assigned the value $\d_i$ and $\A\models\theta(\d)$, we have that $\theta(\x)\models \z = \x_i$. But if this is the case, then $X_{\lambda(i)}(\x_i), \neg X_{\lambda(i)}(\z)$ and $\z = \x_i$ are all logical consequences of $\varphi(\x,\X)$, which means $\varphi(\x,\X)$ is inconsistent. That is, there's no structure $\A^\prime\in\Truc$ such that $\A^\prime\models\exists\x\:\varphi(\x,\R^\prime)$ for any assignment $\R^\prime$ to $\X$. In particular, $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\R^\prime)$ for every possible assignment $\R^\prime$ to $\X$, which contradicts the initial assumption that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\R)$ for some assignment $\R$ to $\X$.
\item[(b)] Note that if $\A \models \alpha_{\min}(\c_1,\ldots,\c_n)$, then necessarily $\c_i = \d_i$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}.$ However, by the construction of $\P$, we see that 
$$\A\not\models\bigvee_{i = 1}^{n}\neg P_{\lambda(i)}(\d_i) \text{ and that } \A\not\models\bigvee_{i=1}^r \exists \v\Big( P_i(\v) \wedge \bigwedge_{j\in[1,n]:\: \lambda(j) = i} \v \neq \d_j\Big).$$ Then, $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\P)$.
\item[(c)] By contradiction, let $\P^\prime \neq \P$ be such that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\P^\prime)$ and $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\P^\prime)$. We consider two cases: first, suppose that $\P^\prime$ is missing a tuple of $\P$. Let $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that in $\d_i$ is not in $P^\prime_i$. Then $\A\models \neg P^\prime_i(\d_i)$, and so,$$\A\models \bigg(\bigvee_{i = 1}^{n}\neg X_{\lambda(i)}(\d_i) \bigg), $$ from which we conclude that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\P^\prime)$. Second, suppose there is some predicate $\P^\prime_i$ in $\P^\prime$ which has a tuple that $P_i$ does not have. If this is the case, then $$\A\models\bigvee_{i=1}^r \exists \v\Big( P_i(\v) \wedge \bigwedge_{j\in[1,n]:\: \lambda(j) = i} \v \neq \u_j\Big),$$ so $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\P^\prime)$. On both cases, we have a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}
With this, we conclude that for every $\A\in\Truc$ such that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)>0,$ we have that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)}(\A) = f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)-1.$

Second, assume that there is no assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\R)$. Let $\P$ be an arbitrary assignment to $\X$. Since $\A\not\models\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\P)$, we see that $\A\not\models\exists\x\,(\varphi(\x,\P)\wedge\psi(\x,\P))$ for any formula $\psi(\x,\P)$. It follows that there is no assignment $\R$ to $\X$ such that $\A\models\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\R)$. And so, for every $\A\in\Truc$ such that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}(\A)=0,$ it holds that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)}(\A) = 0.$ We conclude that $f_{\exists\x\,\varphi^\prime(\x,\X)} = f_{\exists\x\,\varphi(\x,\X)}\dotminus 1,$ which was to be shown.
