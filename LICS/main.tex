\begin{abstract}
Descriptive Complexity has been very successful in characterizing complexity classes of decision problems in terms of the properties definable in some logics. However, descriptive complexity for counting complexity classes, such as $\fp$ and $\shp$, has not been systematically studied, and it is not as developed as its decision counterpart. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Weighted Logics to address this issue. Specifically, by focusing on the natural numbers we obtained a logic called Quantitative Second Order Logics (QSO), and show how some of its fragments can be used to capture fundamental counting complexity classes such as $\fp$, $\shp$ and $\fpspace$, among others. We also use QSO to define a hierarchy inside $\shp$, identifying counting complexity classes with good closure and approximation properties, and which admit natural complete problems. Finally, we add recursion to QSO, and show how this extension naturally captures lower counting complexity classes such as $\shl$.	
	
%The goal of descriptive complexity is to measure the complexity of a problem in terms of the logical constructors needed to express it. 
%The starting point of this branch of complexity theory is Fagin's theorem, which states that $\np$ is equal to existential second-order logic. Since then, many more decision complexity classes have been characterized in terms of the properties definable in a logic. 
%Unfortunately, descriptive complexity for function complexity classes (e.g. $\shp$, $\fp$) has not been systematically studied and it is not as developed as for the case of decision problems.
%
%In this paper, we propose to study the descriptive complexity of function complexity classes in terms of Weighted Logics (WL), a general logical framework that combines boolean formulas (e.g. FO, SO) with operations over a fix semirings (e.g. $\bbN$). 
%Specifically, we propose to restrict WL over natural numbers, called Quantitative Second Order Logics (QSO), and study its expressive power for defining function complexity classes over general structures. 
%Interestingly, we show that fragments of QSO naturally captures classes like $\shp$, $\fp$ and $\fpspace$ among others. 
%Then we study the structure of $\eqso$, a fragment of $\qso$ that captures $\shp$, by refining the hierarchy studied by Saluja et al. 
%In particular, we show fragments of $\eqso$ that have good properties in terms of decidability, closure properties, and natural complete problems. 
%Finally, we go beyond QSO by adding recursion over functions. We show that this new logic naturally captures $\fp$ and subclasses like $\shl$.
