\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{theo-pnf-snf}}
Recall that a formula in $\eqso(\LL)$ is on the following grammar:
$$
\alpha = \varphi \ \mid \ s \ \mid \ (\alpha + \alpha) \ \mid \ \sa{x} \alpha \ \mid \ \sa{X} \alpha,
$$
where $\varphi$ is a formula in $\LL$ and $s\in\nat$. We will construct a recursive function $\tau$ such that for every $\eqso(\LL)$ formula $\alpha$, it outputs an equivalent formula $\tau(\alpha)$ which is in $\LL$-SNF. If $\alpha = \varphi$, then we define $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha$ which is clearly equivalent and already in $\LL$-SNF. If $\alpha = s$, then we define $(\top \add \cdots \add \top)$ ($s$ times), which also satisfies the condition. We assume that for every sub-formula $\beta$ of $\alpha$, $\tau(\beta)$ is an equivalent formula in $\LL$-SNF. If $\alpha = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$, then we define $\tau(\alpha) = (\tau(\alpha_1) + \tau(\alpha_2))$. If $\alpha = \sa{x}\beta$, then let $\tau(\beta) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\beta_i$ where each $\beta_i$ is in $\LL$-PNF. We have that each $\beta_i$ also is in $\LL$-PNF, and then we define $\tau(\alpha) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m}\sa{x}\beta_i$ which satisfies the condition. If $\alpha = \sa{X}\beta$, then we proceed analogously as in the previous case. This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$ and we conclude the proof by taking $\tau(\alpha)$ as the desired rewrite of $\alpha$.












\subsection*{Proof of theorem \ref{theo-pi1-pnf}}
We divide the proof in three parts.

\vspace{1em}
First, we prove that the formula $\alpha_{0} = \sa{X(\cdot)}1 + 1$ is not equivalent to any formula in $\loge{0}$-PNF. Suppose that there exists some formula $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ in $\loge{0}$-PNF that is equivalent to the $\eqso(\loge{0})$ formula $\sa{X(\cdot)}1 + 1$. Note that this defines the function $2^{n}+1$, where $n$ is the size of the input structure. Then, note that if $\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ is not satisfiable, then the function is null. Note also that if $\length(\bar{X}) = \length(\bar{x}) = 0$, then the function defined by $\alpha$ is never greater than 1. Now note that $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ is equivalent to a function in $\E{0}$. The authors in \cite{SalujaST95} proved that if $\length(\bar{X}) > 0$, then the function defined by the formula, for big enough structures, is always even. And since $\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{x})$ defines a polynomially bounded function, we follow to a contradiction.

\vspace{1em}
Second, we prove that the formula $\alpha_{1} = 2$ is not equivalent to any formula in $\loge{1}$-PNF. Suppose that there exists some formula $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\, \varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ in $\loge{1}$-PNF that is equivalent to the $\eqso(\loge{1})$ formula $2$. Suppose that $\varphi$ is quantifier-free. Note first that if $\length(\bar{X}) = \length(\bar{x}) = 0$, then the function defined by $\alpha$ is never greater than 1. Consider an ordered structure $\A$. Since $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = 2$, there exist at least two assignations $(\bar{B}_1,\bar{b}_1,\bar{a}_1)$, $(\bar{B}_2,\bar{b}_2,\bar{a}_2)$ to $(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ such that for both, $\A\models\varphi(\bar{B}_i,\bar{b}_i,\bar{a}_i)$. Now consider the ordered structure $\A'$ that is obtained by duplicating $\A$. This is, each half of $\A'$ is isomorphic to $\A$. Note that $\A'\models\varphi(\bar{B}_i,\bar{b}_i,\bar{a}_i)$ for $i = 1,2$ and there exists a third assignation $(\bar{B}_1',\bar{b}_1',\bar{a}_1')$ that is identical to $(\bar{B}_1,\bar{b}_1,\bar{a}_1)$ but in the other half to the structure such that $\A'\models\varphi(\bar{B}_1',\bar{b}_1',\bar{a}_1')$. We have that $\sem{\alpha}(\A) \geq 3$, and we follow to a contradiction.

\vspace{1em}
We now show that if $\LL$ contains $\logu{1}$ and is closed under conjunction and disjunction, then for every formula $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\LL)$ there is an equivalent formula $\beta$ in $\LL$-PNF. As in Theorem \ref{theo-pnf-snf}, we show a recursive function $\tau$ that produces such formula. As we showed, there exists an equivalent formula in $\LL$-SNF, so we assume that $\alpha$ is in that form. Let $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i$ where each $\alpha_i$ is in $\LL$-SNF. Let $\alpha_i = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x})$. We replace each $\alpha_i$ for the equivalent formula $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{Y}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{y}(\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\forall z\,Y(z) \wedge \forall z(y \leq z))$ to obtain that $\length(\bar{X}) > 0$ and $\length(\bar{x}) > 0$. 

Now we begin describing the function $\tau$. If $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$, then the formula is already in $\LL$-PNF so we define $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha$. If $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$, then we assume that $\tau(\alpha_1) = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ and $\tau(\alpha_2) = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\psi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$. The construction that we will provide for this function works by identifying a ``first'' assignment for both $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ and $(\bar{Y},\bar{y})$ and a ``last'' assignment for both $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ and $(\bar{Y},\bar{y})$. These are identified by the following formulas:
\begin{align*}
\gamma_{\text{first}}(\bar{X},\bar{x}) &= \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z}\neg X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{x}\leq\bar{z}), \\
\gamma_{\text{last}}(\bar{X},\bar{x}) &= \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z} X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{x}).
\end{align*}
In other words, the ``first'' assignment is the one where every second-order predicate is empty and the first-order assignment is the lexicographically smallest, and the ``last'' assignment is the one where every second-order predicate is full and the first-order assignment is the lexicographically greatest. We also need to identify assignments that are not first and are not last. We do this by negating the two formulas above, and we use a concatenation of the quantified first-order variables:
\begin{align*}
\gamma_{\text{not first}}(\bar{X},\bar{x}) &= \exists\bar{z}(\bar{z}_0 < \bar{x} \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})}X(\bar{z}_i)), \\
\gamma_{\text{not last}}(\bar{X},\bar{x}) &= \exists\bar{z}(\bar{x} < \bar{z}_0 \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})}\neg X(\bar{z}_i)),
\end{align*}
where $\bar{z} = (\bar{z}_0,\bar{z}_1,\ldots,\bar{z}_{\length(\bar{X})})$. The following formula is equivalent to $\alpha$:
\begin{align}
\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{Y}}\sa{\bar{y}}[&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{not first}}(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{first}}(\bar{Y},\bar{y}))\vee\\
&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{first}}(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{last}}(\bar{Y},\bar{y}))\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\gamma_{\text{first}}(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{not last}}(\bar{Y},\bar{y}))\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\gamma_{\text{last}}(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\gamma_{\text{last}}(\bar{Y},\bar{y}))].
\end{align}
To show that the formula is indeed equivalent to $\alpha$, note three facts. First, the formulas in lines (2) and (3) form a partition over the assignments of $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$, while fixing an assignment for $(\bar{Y},\bar{y})$. Second, the formulas in lines (4) and (5) form a partition over the assignments of $(\bar{Y},\bar{y})$, while fixing an assignment for $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$. And third, the four lines define pairwise disjoint assignments for $(\bar{X},\bar{x}),(\bar{Y},\bar{y})$.

However, the formula is not yet in the correct form. By expanding it we obtain:
\begin{align*}
\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{Y}}\sa{\bar{y}}[&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\exists\bar{v}(\bar{v}_0 < \bar{x} \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})}X(\bar{v}_i))\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z}\neg Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{y}\leq\bar{z})\vee\\
&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z}\neg X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{x}\leq\bar{z})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z} Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{y}))\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z}\neg X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{x}\leq\bar{z})\wedge\exists\bar{w}(\bar{y} < \bar{w}_0 \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})}\neg Y(\bar{w}_i))\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z} X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{x})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z} Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{y}))].
\end{align*}
To construct an equivalent formula that is in the correct form, we define $\bar{u} = (\bar{v},\bar{w})$ and we replace the first-order quantifiers by a first-sum and count the first assignment to $\bar{v}$ and $\bar{w}$ that satisfies the formula. A similar construction was used in \cite{SalujaST95}. We obtain:
\begin{align*}
\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{Y}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{y}}\sa{\bar{u}}[&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge(\bar{v}_0 < \bar{x} \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})}X(\bar{v}_i))\wedge\forall\bar{u}'((\bar{v}_0' < \bar{x} \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})}X(\bar{v}_i'))\to\bar{u}\leq\bar{u}') \wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z}\neg Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{y}\leq\bar{z})\vee\\
&(\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z}\neg X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{x}\leq\bar{z})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z} Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{y})\wedge\forall\bar{u}'(\bar{u}\leq\bar{u}'))\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z}\neg X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{x}\leq\bar{z})\wedge(\bar{y} < \bar{w}_0 \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})}\neg Y(\bar{w}_i))\wedge\forall\bar{u}'(\bar{y} < \bar{w}_0' \vee \bigvee_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})}\neg Y(\bar{w}_i'))\to\bar{u}\leq\bar{u}')\vee\\
&(\psi(\bar{Y},\bar{y})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{X})} \forall\bar{z} X_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{x})\wedge\bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\length(\bar{Y})} \forall\bar{z} Y_i(\bar{z}) \wedge \forall\bar{z}(\bar{z}\leq\bar{y})\wedge\forall\bar{u}'(\bar{u}\leq\bar{u}'))].
\end{align*}
This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$.

Finally, consider a $\eqso(\LL)$ formula $\alpha$ in $\LL$-SNF. If $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^n\alpha_i$, then consider $\alpha = (\alpha_1 + (\sum_{i = 2}^n\alpha_i))$. Then we use $\tau(\alpha)$ as the rewrite of $\alpha$, which satisfies the condition in the hypothesis.










\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{prop-rest}}
We give this proof in three parts.

\vspace{1em}
First, we show that $\QE{0} \not\subseteq \E{1}$. By contradiction, suppose that there is a $\QE{0}$ formula $\alpha$ over some signature $\R$ such that defines the following function. For every finite $\R$-structure with $n$ elements, and where every predicate in $\R$ is empty, $\alpha(\enc(\A)) = n - 1$. We use the following claim.
\begin{claim}
Let $\alpha = \sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{x})$	where $\varphi$ is quantifier free. Then the function defined by $\alpha$ is either null, greater or equal to $n$, or is in $\Omega(n^2)$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that the function defined by $\alpha$ is not $0$ and that $\varphi$ is in DNF. Furthermore, suppose $\bar{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_{\length(\bar{x})})$. Then $\alpha = \sa{\bar{x}} \varphi_1(\bar{x}) \vee \cdots \vee \varphi_n(\bar{x})$. Since $\alpha$ is not null, then some $\varphi_i$ must be satisfiable. This is, the function defined by $\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{x})$ is not null. We will prove by induction on $\length(\bar{x})$ that the function defined by $\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{x})$ is either greater or equal to $n$, or in $\Omega(n^2)$. We address the case $\length(\bar{x})= 1$, then $\alpha = \sa{x}\bigwedge\psi(x)$. If any $\psi(x) = (x = x)$ or $\neg(x < x)$, then we can eliminate it and we obtain the same function. If any $\psi = (x < x)$ or $\neg(x=x)$, then the function becomes null. If $\psi(x) = R(x,\ldots,x)$ for some $R\in\R$ the function becomes null for the structures we are considering. If $\psi(x) = \neg R(x,\ldots,x)$, we can eliminate it and for the structures we are considering we obtain the same function. The only possible $\alpha$ left is $\alpha = \sa{x}\top$ which is equal to the function $n$. This covers all possible cases for $\length(\bar{x}) = 1$. Now suppose that it holds for $\length(\bar{x}) = k$ and suppose $\alpha = \sa{\bar{x}}\bigwedge\psi(\bar{x})$ for $\length(\bar{x}) = k+1$. If any $\psi(\bar{x}) = (x_i = x_j)$ where $i \neq j$, then $\alpha$ describes the same function as $\alpha$ where $x_j$ has been replaced by $x_i$. In this formula the tuple of first-order variables has $k$ elements so the function it describes if one of the mentioned in the hypothesis. If $i = j$, then we can eliminate it and obtain the same function. If any $\psi(\bar{x}) = R(\bar{v})$ or $\neg R(\bar{v})$ where $\bar{v}$ is a sub-tuple of $\bar{x}$ then we can either eliminate it or the function becomes null, following the same argument as in the case $\length(\bar{x}) = 1$. If any $\psi(\bar{x}) = \neg(x_i = x_j)$ or $(x_i < x_j)$ where $i = j$, then the function becomes null. If any $\psi(\bar{x}) = \neg(x_i < x_j)$ where $i = j$, we can eliminate it. The remaining formulas in $\bigwedge\psi(\bar{x})$ are either $\neg(x_i = x_j)$, $(x_i<x_j)$ or $\neg(x_i<x_j)$. If the formula violates transitivity in $<$ (for example, $x < y \wedge y < z \wedge z < x$), then the function $\alpha$ describes is null. Therefore, there is some order over $\bar{x}$ that satisfies $\bigwedge\psi(\bar{x})$. Consider the formula that describes this order (like $x_1 < x_3 \wedge x_3 < x_4 \wedge x_4 < x_2$). The function $\alpha$ describes is greater or equal to the one this formula describes, which is exactly $\binom{n}{\length(\bar{x})}$ which is in $\Omega(n^{\length(\bar{x})}) \subseteq \Omega(n^2)$ if $\length(\bar{x}) > 1$. This concludes the proof of the claim.
\end{proof}
We suppose that $\alpha$ is in SNF, this is, $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^n\alpha_i$. Since $\alpha$ is not null, consider some $\alpha_i$ that describes a non-null function. Let $\alpha_i = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x})$, where $\varphi$ is quantifier-free. Note that if $\length(\bar{X}) > 0$, then the function $\alpha$ describes is in $\Omega(2^n)$, as it was proven by the authors in \cite{SalujaST95}. We have that $\alpha_i = \sa{\bar{x}}\varphi(\bar{x})$, as we proved in the claim, describes either some function greater or equal to $n$, or in $\Omega(n^2)$, which leads to a contradiction. Lastly, note that the formula $\sa{x}\exists y(x < y)$ is in $\E{0}$ and describes the function $n-1$, which concludes the proof.

\vspace{1em}
Now we show that $\E{1}\not\subseteq\QE{0}$. In Theorem \ref{theo-pi1-pnf} we proved that there is no formula in $\loge{1}$-PNF equivalent to the formula $\alpha = 2$. Every formula in $\E{1}$ can be expressed in $\loge{1}$-PNF, which implies that $2 \in \QE{0}$ and $2 \not\in \E{1}$.

\vspace{1em}
Lastly, we prove that $\eqso(\loge{1})\subsetneq\eqso(\logu{1})$. For inclusion, let $\alpha$ be a formula in $\eqso(\loge{1})$. Suppose that it is in $\loge{1}$-SNF. This is, $\alpha = c + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\alpha_i$. Let $\alpha_i = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, where $\varphi_i$ is quantifier-free, for each $\alpha_i$. We use the same construction used in \cite{SalujaST95}, and we obtain that the formula $\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is equivalent to $\sa{\bar{y}}\,\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) \wedge \forall\bar{y}'(\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}')\to\bar{y}\leq\bar{y}')$ for every assignment to $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$. We do this replacement for each $\alpha_i$ and we obtain an equivalent formula in $\eqso(\logu{1})$.

To prove that the inclusion is proper, consider the $\eqso(\logu{1})$ formula $\sa{x}\forall y(y = x)$. This formula defines the following function that takes an ordered structure $\A$ as input:
$$
\sem{\alpha}(\A) = 
\begin{cases}
1 &\A \text{ has one element}\\
0 &\text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
Suppose that there exists an equivalent formula $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\loge{1})$. Also, suppose that it is in $\L$-PNF, so $\alpha = c + \sum_{i = 1}^n\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$. Since $\alpha$ takes the value 0 for some structures, $c$ must be 0. Consider a structure with one element $\mathfrak{1}$. We have that for some $i$, there exists an assignment $(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$ for $(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ such that $\mathfrak{1}\models\varphi_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$. Consider now the structure $\mathfrak{2}$ that is obtained by duplicating $\mathfrak{1}$, as we did for Theorem \ref{theo-pi1-pnf}. Note that $\mathfrak{2}\models\varphi_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$, which implies that $\sem{\alpha}(\mathfrak{2}) \geq 1$, which leads to a contradiction.










\subsection*{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop-e1-nc}}

Towards a contradiction, assume that the statement is false. This is, that $\E{1}$ is closed under binary sum. Consider the formula $\sa{x}(x = x)$ which is in $\E{1}$ over some signature $\R$. For every finite $\R$-structure $\A$ with $n$ elements, and where every predicate in $\R$ is empty, $\alpha(\enc(\A)) = n$. From our assumption, there exists some formula in $\E{1}$ equivalent to the formula $\alpha \add \alpha$, which describes the function $2n$. Let $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ be this formula, where $\varphi$ is quantifier-free. Note that the function defined by this formula is equal or greater than the one defined by $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{y}}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ divided by a polynomial factor. More specifically, for each ordered structure $\A$ with domain $A$, we have the following inequality:
$$
\sem{\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})}(\A) \cdot \vert A \vert^{\length(\bar{y})} \geq \sem{\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{y}}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})}(\A)
$$
Note that the formula $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\sa{\bar{y}}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ defines a function in $\E{0}$. It was shown by the authors in \cite{SalujaST95} that every function in $\E{0}$ grows exponentially over the size of the structure for large enough structures, when $\length(\bar{X}) > 0$. This function divided by a polynomial factor still grows exponentially. Therefore, for $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ we have that $\length(\bar{X}) = 0$.

Now, for the formula $\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ consider a structure $\mathfrak{1}$ with only one element $a$. We have that $\sem{\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})}(\mathfrak{1}) = 2$, but the only possible assignment to $\bar{x}$ is the tuple $(a,\ldots,a)$ so $\sem{\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})}(\mathfrak{1}) \leq 1$, which follows to a contradiction.










\subsection*{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:qe0-fp-qe1-totp-fptras}}

We separate this proof in three parts

\vspace{1em}
The authors in \cite{SalujaST95} proved that there exists a {\em product reduction} from every function in $\E{1}$ to a restricted version of $\cdnf$. This is, if $\alpha\in\E{1}$ over some signature $\R$, there exist polynomially computable functions $g:\ostr[\R]\to\ostr[\R_{\text{DNF}}]$ and $h:\nat\to\nat$ such that for every finite $\R$-structure $\A$ with domain $A$, it holds that $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \cdnf(\enc(g(\A)))\cdot h(\vert A \vert)$. We base our proof on this fact.

For the first part, let $\alpha$ be a $\eqso(\loge{1})$ formula and assume that it is in $\loge{1}$-SNF. This is, $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^n\alpha_i$ where each $\alpha_i$ is in $\loge{1}$-PNF. Consider the following nondeterministic procedure that on input $\enc(\A)$ generates $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$ branches. For each $\alpha_i = \varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a $\loge{1}$ formula, it checks if $\A\models\varphi$ in polynomial time and generates a new branch if that is the case. For each $\alpha_i = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi$, this formula is also in $\E{1}$. We use the reduction to $\cdnf$ provided in \cite{SalujaST95} and we obtain $g(\enc(\A))$, which is an instance to $\cdnf$. Since $\cdnf$ is also in $\totp$ \cite{PagourtzisZ06}, we simulate the corresponding nondeterministic procedure that generates exactly $\cdnf(\enc(g(\A)))$ branches. Since, $\fp\subseteq\totp$\cite{PagourtzisZ06}, each polynomially computable function is also in $\totp$, and then on each of these branches we simulate the corresponding nondeterministic procedure to generate $h(\vert A \vert)$ more. The number of branches for each $\alpha_i$ is $\sem{\alpha_i}(\A) = \cdnf(\enc(g(\A)))\cdot h(\vert A \vert)$, and the total number of branches in the procedure amounts to $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$. We conclude that $\alpha\in\totp$.

\vspace{1em}
For the second part, let $\alpha$ be a $\eqso(\loge{1})$ formula and assume that it is in $\loge{1}$-SNF. This is, $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^n\alpha_i$ where each $\alpha_i$ is in $\loge{1}$-PNF. Note that each $\alpha_i$ that is equal to some $\loge{1}$ formula $\varphi$ has an FPRAS given by the procedure that simply checks if $\A\models\varphi$ and returns 1 if it does and 0 otherwise. Also, each remaining $\alpha_i$ has an FPRAS since $\alpha_i\in \E{1}$ \cite{SalujaST95}. If two functions have an FPRAS, then their sum also has one given by the procedure that simulates them both and sums the results. We conclude that $\alpha$ has an FPRAS.

\vspace{2em}
For the third part, we will prove that $\eqso(\loge{1})$ is closed under sum and multiplication. Since $\eqso(\loge{1})$ is closed under sum by definition, we focus only in proving that the class is closed under multiplication. We prove this for a more general case for $\eqso(\LL)$ where $\LL$ is a fragment of $\so$.

Let $\LL$ be a fragment {\bf closed under conjunction}. We will define a recursive function $\tau$ that receives a formula $\alpha$ over the grammar of $\eqso(\LL)$ extended by binary product, and outputs an equivalent formula $\tau(\alpha)$ over the unextended grammar of $\eqso(\LL)$. In fact, the formula $\tau(\alpha)$ is in $\LL$-SNF. First we replace each constant $s$ in $\alpha$ for $(\top \add \cdot \add \top)$ ($s$ times). If $\alpha = \varphi$, then we define $\tau(\alpha) = \alpha$. We assume that for every $\beta$ that has less algebraic operators than $\alpha$, $\tau(\beta)$ is in $\LL$-SNF. If $\alpha = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$ then we define $\tau(\alpha) = \tau(\alpha_1) + \tau(\alpha_2)$. If $\alpha = \sa{x}\beta$ or $\alpha = \sa{X}\beta$, then we define $\tau(\alpha)$ as the formula in $\LL$-SNF that is equivalent to $\sa{x}\tau(\beta)$ and to $\tau(\alpha) = \sa{X}\tau(\beta)$, respectively. If $\alpha = (\alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2)$, we assume that each $\alpha_i$ is in $\LL$-SNF. We identify three cases. (1) Some $\alpha_i$ is equal to $\sum_{j = 1}^n\beta_j$ for $n > 1$. Suppose wlog. that it is $\alpha_1$. We then define $\tau(\alpha) = \sum_{j = 1}^n\tau(\beta_j\cdot\alpha_2)$. In the following cases, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are in $\LL$-SNF. (2) If some $\alpha_i$ is equal to $\sa{X}\beta$ or $\sa{x}\beta$, we define $\tau(\alpha)$ as the $\LL$-SNF formula that is equivalent to $\sa{x}\tau(\beta\cdot\alpha_2)$ and $\sa{X}\tau(\beta\cdot\alpha_2)$, respectively. The remaining case is (3) $\alpha_1 = \varphi_1$ and $\alpha_2 = \varphi_2$ where each $\varphi$ is an $\LL$ formula. Then we define $\tau(\alpha) = \varphi_1 \wedge \varphi_2$. This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$. 

For every pair of formulas $\alpha,\beta$ in $\eqso(\LL)$, we have that their multiplication $(\alpha\cdot\beta)$ is a formula in the grammar $\eqso(\LL)$ extended by binary product, and so, there exists an equivalent formula $\tau(\alpha\cdot\beta)$ which is in unextended $\eqso(\LL)$. Since $\loge{1}$ is closed under conjunction, this also holds for $\eqso(\loge{1})$. This concludes the proof.










\subsection*{Proof of Proposition \ref{pi-minusone}}

Let $\LL$ be a fragment of $\fo$ that contains $\logu{1}$. Then we have that every function in $\U{1}$ is expressible in $\eqso(\LL)$. In particular, $\ctcnf \in \eqso(\LL)$. Suppose that $\eqso(\LL)$ is closed under subtraction by one. Then, the function $\ctcnf-1$, which counts the number of satisfying assignments of a 3-CNF formula minus one, is also in $\eqso(\LL)$. Note that $\eqso(\LL) \subseteq \eqso(\fo) = \shp$. We have that $\ctcnf$ is $\shp$-complete under parsimonious reductions\footnote{It can be easily verified that the standard reduction from SAT to 3-CNF (or 3-SAT) preserves the number of satisfying assignments}. Now, let $f$ be a function in $\shp$, and consider the nondeterministic polynomial-time procedure that on input $\enc(\A)$ computes the corresponding reduction to $\ctcnf$, name it $g(\enc(\A))$, and simulates the $\shp$ procedure for $\ctcnf-1$ on input $g(\enc(\A))$. We have that this is a $\shp$ procedure that computes $f-1$, from which we conclude that $\shp$ is closed under subtraction by one.










\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{sigmafo-minusone}}

We divide the proof in two parts.

\vspace{1em}
First, note that for every fragment $\LL$ of $\so$ the class $\eqso(\LL)$ is closed under sum by definition, and if $\LL$ is closed under conjunction, like $\logex{1}$ is, $\eqso(\LL)$ is closed under product. We are only left to prove that $\eqso(\logex{1})$ is closed under subtraction by one.

Let $\alpha$ be a $\eqso(\logex{1})$ formula over a signature $\R$. We will define a $\eqso(\logex{1})$ formula $\kappa(\alpha)$ such that for each finite structure $A$ over $\R$: $\sem{\kappa(\alpha)}(\A) = \sem{\alpha}(\A) \dotminus 1$. We suppose that $\alpha$ is in $\logex{1}$-SNF and $\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi_i$ where each $\varphi_i$ is in $\logex{1}$. Moreover, we assume that $\length(\bar{x}) > 0$ since we can replace each $\varphi_i$ for the equivalent formula $\sa{y}\varphi_i\wedge\min(y)$.

The intuition behind our reasoning is separated in three points: (1) For each $\beta_i$ of the form $\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi$, the formula $\kappa(\beta_i)$ will count every tuple $\bar{x}$ that satisfies $\varphi$ except for the lexicographically smallest one. (2) For each $\beta_i$ of the form $\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi$, the formula $\kappa(\beta_i)$ will isolate the smallest $\bar{X}$ that satisfies $\varphi$, and exclude the lexicographically smallest tuple $\bar{x}$ that satisfies $\varphi(\bar{X})$. And (3) if $\alpha = (\beta\add\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi)$ or $\alpha = (\beta\add\sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\varphi)$, the formula $\kappa(\alpha)$ will exclude the lexicographically smallest tuple that satisfies $\varphi$ if and only if $\beta$ is equal to 0.

\vspace{1em}

For each $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\logex{1})$ such that $\alpha = \sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ for some quantifier-free formula $\varphi$, we define $\kappa(\alpha) = \sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}[\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})\wedge\exists\bar{z}(\varphi(\bar{z},\bar{y})\wedge\bar{z} < \bar{x})]$, which is in $\eqso(\logex{1})$ and fulfils the desired condition.

\vspace{1em}

For each $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\logex{1})$ such that $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ for some quantifier-free formula $\varphi$, we define $\kappa(\alpha)$ procedurally as follows: Let $\bar{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_{\length(\bar{x})})$ and $\bar{X} = (X_1,\ldots,X_{\length(\bar{X})})$. We suppose that $\varphi$ is in a DNF form that leaves formulas that do not mention $\bar{X}$ intact. If it is not, we convert $\varphi$ to this form with a standard transformation algorithm. Let $\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) = \bigvee_{i = 1}^m\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ where each $\varphi_i$ has the form:
$$
\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) = (\text{conjunction of $X_j$'s}) \wedge (\text{conjunction of $\neg X_j$'s})  \wedge (\text{an $\fo$ formula that does not mention any $X_j$}).
$$
Define $\varphi_i^{+}$, $\varphi_i^{-}$ and $\varphi_i^{\fo}$ as the formulas mentioned above. 

In our procedure we assume that in $\varphi_i^{+}\wedge\varphi_i^{-}$ every first-order variable from $\bar{x},\bar{y}$ is mentioned at most once. If not, we add new first-order variables from $\fv$ to $\bar{y}$ so that no variable is repeated, replace them in $\varphi_i^{+}\wedge\varphi_i^{-}$ and add their respective equalities in $\varphi_i^{\fo}$ so that the new formula is equivalent. For example, if $\bar{x} = x$, $\bar{y} = y$ and $\varphi_i = X(x,y)\wedge \neg X(x,x) \wedge x < y$, then we redefine $\bar{y} = (y,v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ and $\varphi_i := X(v_1,v_2) \wedge \neg X(v_3,v_4) \wedge x < y \wedge v_1 = x \wedge v_2 = y \wedge v_3 = x \wedge v_4 = x.$ 

Furthermore, we assume that $\varphi_i^{\fo}$ defines an ordered partition of the variables in the tuple $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. For example, let $\bar{x} = (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$. A possible ordered partition would be defined by the formula $\theta(\bar{x}) = x_2 < x_1 \wedge x_1 = x_4 \wedge x_4 < x_3$. On the other hand, the formula $\theta'(\bar{x}) = x_1 < x_2 \wedge x_1 < x_4 \wedge x_2 = x_3$ does not define an ordered partition since both $\{x_1\}<\{x_2,x_3\}<\{x_4\}$ and $\{x_1\} < \{x_2,x_3,x_4\}$ satisfy $\theta'$.
For a given $k$, we define $\cB_k$ as the number of possible ordered partitions for a set of size $k$. 
If $\varphi_i^{\fo}$ does not define an ordered partition, then for $1 \leq j \leq \cB_{\length(\bar{x},\bar{y})}$ 
let $\theta^j(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ be a formula that defines an ordered partition over $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. The formula $\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is converted into $\bigvee_{j = 1}^{\cB_{\length(\bar{x},\bar{y})}}\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) \wedge \theta^j(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. Consider each of these disjuncts as a new $\varphi_i$.

After the previous assumptions, we do the following: for each $X_j\in \bar{X}$ we check every instance of $X_j(\bar{w})$ in $\varphi^{+}_i$ and every instance of $X_j(\bar{z})$ in $\varphi^{-}_i$, where $\bar{w}$ and $\bar{z}$ are subtuples of $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. If the ordered partition in $\varphi^{\fo}_i$ satisfies $\bar{w} = \bar{z}$, the entire formula $\varphi_i$ is removed from $\varphi$.

Now let $\bar{v}$ be the tuple of every first-order variable mentioned in $\varphi_i^{+}$ and let $\bar{u}$ be such that $(\bar{x},\bar{y}) = (\bar{u},\bar{v})$. We define a formula $\mu_i$ that is satisfied only by the lexicographically smallest $\bar{v}$ that satisfies $\varphi_i^{\fo}$ for some $\bar{u}$:
$$
\mu_i(\bar{v}) = \exists\bar{u}\,\varphi_i^{\fo}(\bar{u},\bar{v})\wedge\forall\bar{u}'\forall\bar{v}'(\varphi_i^{\fo}(\bar{u}',\bar{v}')\to\bar{v}\leq\bar{v}').
$$
The following is a pivotal formula for this proof. Consider some ordered finite structure $\A$ over $\R$. Given our conditions for $\varphi_i$, if $\A\models\varphi_i$ and $\A\models\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{u},\bar{v})$ then for that $\bar{v}$ we can define a $\bar{X}$ that has exactly the tuples mentioned in $\bar{v}$ and nothing else. This is {\em the smallest $\bar{X}$ that satisfies $\varphi_i$ over $\bar{v}$}. And if $\bar{v}$ is the lexicographically smallest such that $\A\models\varphi_i(\bar{v})$, then it is the {\em the smallest $\bar{X}$ that satisfies $\varphi_i$}. The following formula is satisfied by every pair $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$, except for the one formed by the smallest $\bar{X}$ that satisfies $\varphi_i$ and the lexicographically smallest $\bar{x}$ that satisfies $\varphi_i(\bar{X})$. And if no pair satisfies $\varphi_i$, the following formula is satisfied by every pair.
$$
\psi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x}) = \exists\bar{v}(\mu_i(\bar{v})\wedge(\neg\varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{v})\vee\bigvee_{X \in \bar{X}} \exists\bar{z}(X(\bar{z}) \wedge \bigwedge\limits_{\substack{\text{instances of }X(\bar{w}) \\ \text{in }\varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{v})}}\bar{w}\neq\bar{z}))) \vee \exists\bar{x}'(\exists\bar{y}'\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x}',\bar{y}')\wedge \bar{x}'<\bar{x})\vee\neg\exists\bar{v}\mu_i(\bar{v}) .
$$
\begin{lemma}
	For a given ordered structure $\A$ such that $\A\models\exists\bar{X}\exists\bar{x}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, there is an assignment $(\bar{B},\bar{b})$ to $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ that satisfies the following conditions (1) $\A\models\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{y})$, (2) $\A\not\models\psi_i(\bar{B},\bar{b})$ and (3) this is the only assignment to $(\bar{X},\bar{x})$ that satisfies (1) and (2).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Excusing the nested proof, we have a claim that identifies a crucial condition that is verifiable with a $\fo$ formula. 
	\begin{claim}
		Let $\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) = \varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{x},\bar{y}) \wedge \varphi^{-}_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) \wedge \varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ be a $\logex{0}$ formula that satisfies all the mentioned assumptions. For a given ordered structure $\A$ it holds that $\A\models\exists\bar{x}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ iff $\A\models\exists\bar{X}\exists\bar{x}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$.
	\end{claim}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\A$ be an ordered structure with domain $A$ and let $\bar{a}\in A^{\length(\bar{y})}$ and $\bar{b}\in A^{\length(\bar{x})}$ such that $\A\models\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{b},\bar{a})$. Define $\bar{B} = (B_1,\ldots,B_{\length(\bar{X})})$ as $B_j = \{\bar{c}\mid\bar{c}\text{ is a subtuple of $(\bar{b},\bar{a})$ and $X_j(\bar{c})$ is mentioned in $\varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{b},\bar{a})$}\}$. Towards a contradiction, suppose that $\A\not\models\varphi_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$. By the choice of $\bar{a}$ and $\bar{b}$, and construction of $\bar{B}$ it is clear that $\A\models\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{b},\bar{a})\wedge\varphi^{+}_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$, so we have that $\A\not\models\varphi^{-}_i(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$. Let $B_t(\bar{c})$ be such that $X_t(\bar{c})$ is mentioned in $\varphi^{-}_i(\bar{X},\bar{b},\bar{a})$ and $\A\not\models\neg B_t(\bar{c})$. This is, $\bar{c}\in B_t$. By the construction of $\bar{B}$ we have that $X_t(\bar{c})$ is mentioned in $\varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{b},\bar{a})$. From our assumptions, we have that (1) every first-order variable is mentioned at most once in $\varphi^{-}_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) \wedge \varphi^{+}_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, (2) $\varphi^{\fo}_i$ defines an ordered partition over $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, and (3) there are no $X_j(\bar{w})$ in $\varphi^{+}_i$ and $X_j(\bar{z})$ in $\varphi^{-}_i$ such that the ordered partition defined by $\varphi^{\fo}_i$ satisfies $\bar{x} = \bar{z}$. Since $\bar{c}$ is a subtuple of $(\bar{b},\bar{a})$ that satisfies $\varphi^{\fo}_i$, and $X_t(\bar{w})$ mentioned in $\varphi^{+}_i$ and $X_t(\bar{z})$ mentioned in $\varphi^{-}_i$ were both assigned the value $\bar{c}$, then the ordered partition satisfies $\bar{w} = \bar{z}$, which follows to a contradiction.
	\end{proof}
	We give the proof for the base theorem. Let $\A$ be an ordered structure with domain $A$. We clearly have that $\A\models\exists\bar{x}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, so let $\bar{a}\in A^{\length(\bar{y})}$ and $\bar{b}\in A^{\length(\bar{x})}$ such that $\A\models\mu_i(\bar{b},\bar{a})$. We use the same construction in the claim and we obtain the assignment $(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$ which satisfies the three conditions.
\end{proof}

We define $\chi_i = \exists\bar{x}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi^{\fo}_i(\bar{x},\bar{y})$. Now recall that $\varphi = \bigvee_{i = 1}^m\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, where each $\varphi_i$ satisfies all the previous assumptions. For each $\varphi_i$ we define:
$$
\varphi_i'(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) = \varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})\wedge\psi_1(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge(\chi_1\vee\psi_2(\bar{X},\bar{x}))\wedge(\chi_1\vee\chi_2\vee\psi_2(\bar{X},\bar{x}))\wedge\cdots\wedge(
\bigvee_{j = 1}^{j = i-1}\chi_j\vee\psi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x})),
$$
and lastly, $\kappa(\alpha)$ is defined as $\kappa(\alpha) = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\bigvee_{i = 1}^m\varphi_i'(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$.

\vspace{1em}

For each $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\logex{1})$ such that $\alpha = (\beta + \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}))$ for some algebraic formula $\beta$ and some quantifier-free formula $\varphi$, we define $\kappa(\alpha)$ as follows: First, perform the same transformations to $\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ as in the previous case. Let $\varphi = \bigvee_{i = 1}^m\varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ where each $\varphi_i$ satisfies the previous assumptions. We also use the previously defined formulas $\chi_i$ and $\psi_i$. 

We recursively define a function $\lambda$ as follows. If $\alpha = \sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\varphi(\bar{x},\bar{y})$, then $\lambda(\alpha) = \exists\bar{x}'\exists\bar{y}'\varphi(\bar{x}',\bar{y}')$. If $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, then let $\varphi = \bigvee_{i = 1}^{m}\varphi_i$ and $\lambda(\alpha) = \chi_1\vee\cdots\vee\chi_m$ as each $\chi_i$ was previously defined. If $\alpha = (\beta + \gamma)$, then $\lambda(\alpha) = \lambda(\beta) \vee \lambda(\gamma)$. Note that for a given ordered structure $\A$, then $\A\models\lambda(\alpha)$ if and only if $\sem{\alpha}(\A) > 0$.

Now, for each $\varphi_i$ we define:
$$
\varphi_i'(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y}) = \varphi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})\wedge[\lambda(\beta)\vee[\psi_1(\bar{X},\bar{x})\wedge(\chi_1\vee\psi_2(\bar{X},\bar{x}))\wedge(\chi_1\vee\chi_2\vee\psi_2(\bar{X},\bar{x}))\wedge\cdots\wedge(
\bigvee_{j = 1}^{j = i-1}\chi_j\vee\psi_i(\bar{X},\bar{x}))]].
$$
And lastly $\kappa(\alpha)$ is defined as $\kappa(\alpha) = \kappa(\beta) + \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\bigvee_{i = 1}^m\varphi_i'(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$, which is in $\eqso(\logex{1})$ and satisfies the desired condition.

\vspace{1em}
For the second part, for each $\alpha$ in $\eqso(\logex{0})$ over a signature $\R$ we will define a formula $\lambda(\alpha)$ in $\eqso(\loge{0})$ over a signature $\R_{\alpha}$, and a function $g_{\alpha}$ that receives a finite $\R$-structure $\A$ and outputs a finite $\R_{\alpha}$-structure $g_{\alpha}(\A)$. Let $\alpha$ be in $\eqso(\logex{0})$. The signature $\R_{\alpha}$ is defined by adding the symbol $R_{\psi}$ for every $\fo$ formula $\psi(\bar{z})$. Each symbol $R_{\psi}$ represents a predicate with arity $\length(\bar{z})$. Then, $\lambda(\alpha)$ is defined by replacing every $\fo$ formula $\psi(\bar{z})$ for $R_{\psi}(\bar{z})$. We now define the function $g_{\alpha}$. Let $\A$ be a $\R$-structure with domain $A$. Let $\A'$ be a $\R_{\alpha}$-structure obtained by copying $\A$ and leaving each $R_{\psi}^{\A}$ empty. For each $\fo$-formula $\psi(\z)$ with $\length(\bar{z})$ open first-order variables, we iterate for every tuple $\bar{a} \in A^{\length(\bar{z})}$. If $\A\models\psi(\bar{a})$, then the tuple $\bar{a}$ is added to $R_{\psi}^{\A'}$. This concludes the construction of $\A'$. Note that the number of $\fo$ subformulas and each arity and tuple size is fixed to $\alpha$, so the entire procedure takes polynomial time over the size of the structure (and $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ has polynomial size over $\A$). We define $g_{\alpha}(\A) = \A'$ and we have that for each finite $\R$-structure $\A$: $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \sem{\lambda(\alpha)}(g_{\alpha}(\A))$. Therefore, we have a parsimonious reduction from $\alpha$ to $\lambda(\alpha)$, which is in $\eqso(\loge{1})$.

To show that $\alpha$ is in $\totp$, consider a procedure that takes an input $\A$, converts it to $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ and simulates the $\totp$ procedure for $\lambda(\alpha)$ on input $g_{\alpha}(\A)$. This procedure generates exactly $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \sem{\lambda(\alpha)}(g_{\alpha}(\A))$ branches, and therefore $\alpha$ is in $\totp$.

To show that $\alpha$ has an FPRAS, consider a procedure that takes an input $\A$, converts it to $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ and simulates the FPRAS for $\lambda(\alpha)$. This procedure also takes polynomial time and satisfies the condition.










\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{sub-pnp}}

Towards a contradiction, suppose that any of the classes $\E{1}$, $\eqso(\loge{1})$, and $\eqso(\logex{1})$ is closed under subtraction.

Let $\R$ include the symbols $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, which describe the following properties. If a finite $\R$-structure $\A$ defines a 3DNF formula $\Phi$, then its domain is the set of variables mentioned in $\Phi$, and for each $i = 1,2,3,4$:
\begin{align*}
	S_1^\A &= \{(a_1,a_2,a_3)\mid (\neg a_1 \wedge \neg a_2 \wedge \neg a_3) \mbox{ appears as a disjunct in }\Phi\},\\
	S_2^\A &= \{(a_1,a_2,a_3)\mid ( a_1 \wedge \neg a_2 \wedge \neg a_3) \mbox{ appears as a disjunct in }\Phi\},\\
	S_3^\A &= \{(a_1,a_2,a_3)\mid ( a_1 \wedge  a_2 \wedge \neg a_3) \mbox{ appears as a disjunct in }\Phi\},\\
	S_4^\A &= \{(a_1,a_2,a_3)\mid ( a_1 \wedge  a_2 \wedge  a_3) \mbox{ appears as a disjunct in }\Phi\}.
\end{align*}
Now we define $f_{\#3DNF} = f_{\psi(T)}$ where
\begin{multline*}
\psi(T) = \exists x \exists y \exists z\, [(S_1(x,y,z) \wedge \neg T(x) \wedge \neg T(y) \wedge \neg T(z)) \vee (S_2(x,y,z) \wedge T(x) \wedge \neg T(y) \wedge \neg T(z)) \, \vee \\ (S_3(x,y,z) \wedge T(x) \wedge T(y) \wedge \neg T(z)) \vee (S_4(x,y,z) \wedge T(x) \wedge T(y) \wedge T(z))].
\end{multline*}
Note that $f_{\#3DNF} \in \#\Sigma_1$. Let $f_{all} = f_{\exists x\:\varphi(x,X)}$, where
$$
\varphi(x,X) = (T(x) \vee \neg T(x)).
$$
Note that $f_{all}$ counts every possible truth assignment (satisfying or not) to a 3DNF formula. Given that $f_{\#3DNF}, f_{all} \in \E{1} \subseteq \eqso(\loge{1}) \subseteq \eqso(\logex{1}) \subseteq \totp$, and at least one of the classes is closed under subtraction, the function $f_{\#3DNF} - f_{all}$ is in $\totp$. However, note that for each $\R$-structure $\A$ that represents a formula $\Phi$, $(f_{\#3DNF} - f_{all})(\A) = 0$ if an only if $\Phi$ is a tautology. The decision version of this function is the $\np$-complete problem $\textsc{Tautology}$. And since the function is in $\totp$, its decision version is also in $\ptime$. We conclude that $\np \subseteq \ptime$.










\subsection*{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:ehorn-pe}}
Pagourtzis and Zachos mention a $\totp$ procedure that computes the number of satisfying assignments of a DNF formula \cite{PagourtzisZ06}. This procedure can be easily extended to receive Horn formulas, and furthermore, a disjunction of Horn formulas. We can deduce that $\shdhsat$ is in $\totp$.

As we show in Proposition \ref{sigma2hard}, $\shdhsat$ is complete for $\eqso(\ehorn)$ under parsimonious reductions. Let $\alpha$ be a formula in $\eqso(\ehorn)$ and let $g_{\alpha}$ be the reduction to $\shdhsat$. The $\totp$ procedure we construct, for each input $\enc(\A)$, is simply to compute $g_{\alpha}(\enc(\A))$, and then simulate the $\totp$ procedure for $\shdhsat$ on input $g_{\alpha}(\enc(\A))$. We conclude that $\alpha$ is in $\totp$.










\subsection*{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:hsat-not-sigma2}} %V.12
We use a similar proof to the one provided by the authors in \cite{SalujaST95} to separate the classes $\E{2}$ and $\U{2}$. Suppose that the statement is false, this is, $\chsat \in \eqso(\loge{2})$. We consider the signature $\R$ that we used as the encoding for a Horn formula (Example \ref{ex-hornsat-esop1}) and that the formula $\alpha \in \eqso(\loge{2})$ follows the encoding in the same way. From what we proved in Theorem \ref{theo-pnf-snf}, we have that every formula in $\eqso(\loge{2})$ can be rewritten in $\loge{2}$-PNF, so we assume that $\alpha$ is in this form. Let $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\,\forall\bar{z}\,\varphi(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z})$. Consider the following Horn formula $\Phi$:
$$
\Phi = p \wedge \bigwedge_{i = 1}^n (t_i \wedge p \to q) \wedge \neg q,
$$
where $n = \length(\bar{x}) + \length(\bar{y}) + 1$. Let $\A$ be the encoding of this formula. In the encoding, each variable appears as an element in the domain of $\A$. This formula is satisfiable, so $\sem{\alpha}(\A) \geq 1$. Let $(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a})$ be an assignment to $(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y})$ such that $\A\models\forall\bar{z}\,\varphi(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a},\bar{z})$. Let $t_{\ell}$ be such that it does not appear in $\bar{b}$ or $\bar{a}$. Consider the induced substructure $\A'$ that is obtained by removing $t_{\ell}$ from $\A$ and $\bar{B}'$ as the subset of $\bar{B}$ obtained by deleting each appearance of $t_{\ell}$ in $\bar{B}$. We have that $\A'\models\forall\bar{z}\,\varphi(\bar{B},\bar{b},\bar{a},\bar{z})$. This is because each subformula of the form $\exists y \neg B_i$ is still true, and universal formulas are monotone over induced substructures. It follows that $\sem{\alpha}(\A') \geq 1$ which is not possible since $\A'$ encodes the formula
$$
\Phi' = p \wedge \bigwedge_{i = 1}^{\ell-1} (t_i \wedge p \to q) \wedge (p\to q) \wedge \bigwedge_{i = \ell+1}^{n} (t_i \wedge p \to q) \wedge \neg q,
$$
which is unsatisfiable. We arrive to a contradiction and we conclude that $\chsat$ is not in $\eqso(\ehorn)$.








\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{sigma2hard}} %V.13

First we prove that $\shdhsat$ is in $\eqso(\ehorn)$. Recall that each instance of $\shdhsat$ is a disjunction of Horn formulas. Let $\R = \{\pP(\cdot,\cdot), \pN(\cdot,\cdot), \pV(\cdot), \pNC(\cdot), \pD(\cdot,\cdot)\}$. Each symbol in this vocabulary is used to indicate the same as in Example \ref{ex-hornsat-esop1}, with the addition of $\pD(d,c)$ which indicates that $c$ is a clause in the formula $d$. Recall that the formula
\begin{align*}
&\forall x \, (\neg \pT(x) \vee \pV(x)) \ \wedge\\
&\forall c \, (\neg \textit{NC}(c) \vee \exists x \, \neg \textit{A}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\
&\forall c \forall x \, (\neg \textit{P}(c,x) \vee \exists y \, \neg \textit{A}(c,y) \vee \textit{T}(x)) \ \wedge\\

defines $\chsat$. We obtain the following formula $\psi(T,A)$ in $\ehorn$:
\begin{align*}
\exists d[&\forall x \, (\neg \pT(x) \vee \pV(x)) \ \wedge\\
&\forall c \, (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee \neg \textit{NC}(c) \vee \exists x \, \neg \textit{A}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\
&\forall c \forall x \, (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\neg \textit{P}(c,x) \vee \exists y \, \neg \textit{A}(c,y) \vee \textit{T}(x)) \ \wedge\\
&\forall c \forall x \, (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\neg \textit{N}(c,x) \vee \textit{T}(x) \vee \neg \textit{A}(c,x)) \ \wedge\\

&\forall c \forall x \, (\neg \pD(c,d)\vee\textit{A}(c,x) \vee \neg\textit{T}(x))]
\end{align*}
effectively defines $\chsat$ as for every disjunction of Horn formulas $\theta = \theta_1\vee\cdots\vee\theta_m$ encoded by an $\R$-structure $\A$, the number of satisfying assignments of $\theta$ is equal to $\sem{\sa{\pT} \sa{\pA} \psi(\pT,\pA)}(\A)$.  Therefore, we conclude that $\shdhsat \in \eqso(\ehorn)$.

\vspace{1em}
We will now prove that $\shdhsat$ is hard for $\eqso$ over a signature $\R$ under parsimonious reductions. For each $\eqso(\ehorn)$ formula $\alpha$ over $\R$, we will define a polynomial-time procedure that computes a function $g_{\alpha}$. This function receives a finite $\R$-structure $\A$ and outputs an instance of $\shdhsat$ such that $\sem{\alpha}(\A) = \shdhsat(g_{\alpha}(\A))$. We suppose that $\alpha$ is in sum normal form and:
$$
\alpha = c + \sum_{i = 1}^{\text{\#clauses}} \sa{\bar{X}}\sa{\bar{x}}\exists\bar{y}\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{n}\forall\bar{z}\,\varphi^i_j(\bar{X},\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z}),
$$
where each $\varphi^i_j$ is a Horn clause.                                                                

Consider a finite $\R$-structure $\A$ with domain $A$. To simplify the proof, we extend our grammar to allow first-order constants. Consider each tuple $\bar{a}\in A^{\length(\bar{x})}$, each $\bar{b}\in A^{\length(\bar{y})}$ and each $\bar{c}\in A^{\length(\bar{z})}$ as a tuple of first-order constants. The following formula defines the same function as $\alpha$:
$$
c + \sum_{i = 1}^{\#clauses} \sum_{\bar{a}\in A^{\length(\bar{x})}} \sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{\bar{b}\in A^{\length(\bar{y})}}\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{n}\bigwedge_{\bar{c}\in A^{\length(\bar{z})}}\varphi^i_j(\bar{X},\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c}).
$$
Note that each $\fo$ formula over $(\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z})$ in each $\varphi^i_j$ has no free variables. Therefore, we can evaluate each of these in polynomial time and replace them by $\perp$ and $\top$ where it corresponds. Each $\varphi^i_j$ will be of the form $\perp \vee\, \chi^i_j(\bar{X})$ or $\top \vee \chi^i_j(\bar{X})$ where $\chi^i_j$ is a disjunction of $\neg X_{\ell}$'s and at most one $X_{\ell}$. The formulas of the form $\top \vee \chi^i_j(\bar{X})$ can be removed entirely, and the formulas of the form $\perp \vee\, \chi^i_j(\bar{X})$ can be replaced by $\chi^i_j(\bar{X})$. We obtain the formula
$$
c + \sum_{i = 1}^{m}\sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{\#d}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{\#c}\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})
$$
where every $\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ is a disjunction of $\neg X_{\ell}$'s and zero or one $X_{\ell}$.

Our idea for the rest of the proof is to define $g_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha = \sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{\#d}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{\#c}\psi^{i}_{j,k}(\bar{X})$, for $\alpha = c$ and for $\alpha = \beta_1 + \cdots + \beta_m$ where each $\beta_i$ is in one of the two previous cases.

If $\alpha$ is equal to $\sa{\bar{X}}\bigvee_{j = 1}^{\#d}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{\#c}\psi_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ where $\psi_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ is a disjunction of $\neg X_{\ell}$'s and zero or one $X_{\ell}$, then we obtain the {\bf propositional formula} $g_{\alpha}(\A) = \bigvee_{j = 1}^{\#d}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{\#c}\psi_{j,k}(\bar{X})$ over the propositional alphabet $\{X(\bar{e}) \mid X \in \bar{X} \text{ and } \bar{e}\in A^{\arity(X)} \}$ which has exactly $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$ satisfying assignments and is precisely a disjunction of Horn formulas.

If $\alpha$ is equal to a constant $c$, then we define $g_{\alpha}(\A)$ as the following formula that has exactly $c$ satisfying assignments:
$$
g_{\alpha}(\A) = \bigvee_{i = 1}^{c}\neg t_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \neg t_{i-1} \wedge t_i \wedge \neg t_{i+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \neg p_c.
$$ 
If $\alpha = \beta_1 + \cdots + \beta_m$, let $g_{\beta_i}(\A) = \bigvee_{j = 1}^{\#d}\bigwedge_{k = 1}^{\#c}\theta^i_{j,k}$ for each $\beta_i$ where each $\theta^i_{j,k}$ is a Horn clause. Let $\Theta_i = g_{\beta_i}(\A)$. We rename the variables in each $\Theta_i$ so none of them are mentioned in any other $\Theta_j$. We add $m$ new variables $t_1,\ldots,t_m$ and we define:
\begin{align*}
g_{\alpha}(\A) = &\bigvee_{i = 1}^{\#d}(\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{\#c}\theta^1_{i,j} \wedge (\bigwedge\limits_{\substack{\text{each } t\\ \text{ mentioned in}\\ \Theta_2,\ldots,\Theta_{m}}}t) \wedge (t_1 \wedge \bigwedge_{\ell = 2}^{m} \neg t_{\ell})) \vee \\ 
&\bigvee_{i = 1}^{\#d}(\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{\#c}\theta^2_{i,j} \wedge (\bigwedge\limits_{\substack{\text{each $t$}\\ \text{ mentioned in}\\ \Theta_1,\Theta_3,\ldots,\Theta_{m}}}t) \wedge (t_2 \wedge \bigwedge\limits_{\substack{\ell = 1 \\ \ell \neq 2}}^{m} \neg t_{\ell})) \vee \cdots \vee\\ 
&\bigvee_{i = 1}^{\#d}(\bigwedge_{j = 1}^{\#c}\theta^m_{i,j} \wedge (\bigwedge\limits_{\substack{\text{each } t\\ \text{ mentioned in}\\ \Theta_2,\ldots,\Theta_{m-1}}}t) \wedge (t_m \wedge \bigwedge_{\ell = 1}^{m-1} \neg t_{\ell})).
\end{align*}
The formula is a disjunction of Horn formulas, and the number of satisfying assignments for this formula is exactly the sum of satisfying assignments for each $g_{\beta_i}(\A)$. This, at the same time, is equal to $\sem{\alpha}(\A)$. This covers all possible cases for $\alpha$, and the entire procedure takes polynomial time.
