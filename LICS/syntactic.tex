In this section we study the fragment of $\eqso(\LL)$ when $\LL$ is a boolean logic contained in $\fo$. We show that by restricting $\LL$ we can find different subclasses below $\shp$ with interesting computational and closure properties. 

From this point on, for each fragment $\FF$ of $\qso$, we will also use $\FF$ to refer to the class of functions defined by the formulas in $\FF$.
